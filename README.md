# Learning Vue

This repository documents my journey through learning the popular [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) framework. My goals for learning it are to add another framework to my toolbelt and have a deeper understanding of the common features of web frameworks - components, declarative UI, hot reloading, etc. - without the overhead or complexity of React and Angular.

The plan is to go through the Vue documentation and then make an example project or two.
